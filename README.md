# Abalone-Age-Prediction-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors
This repository explores the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm for predicting the age of abalone based on physical measurements. The Abalone Dataset contains various physical measurements of abalone shells, including length, diameter, height, and weight.
