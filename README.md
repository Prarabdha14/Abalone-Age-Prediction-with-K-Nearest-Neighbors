Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes data loading, handling missing values (if any), and feature scaling.

K-NN Implementation: Implements the K-NN algorithm using scikit-learn library.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Explores different values of 'k' (number of neighbors) to find the optimal model performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: Visualizes the relationship between features and age
